Here you can find the source code for the web server.

## Running the Web Server

* Install all node modules with `npm install` in the `www` directory
* Install pm2 also globally if you haven't done so before with `npm install -g pm2`
* Then you can start the web server (controlled by pm2) with `pm2 start server.js`
