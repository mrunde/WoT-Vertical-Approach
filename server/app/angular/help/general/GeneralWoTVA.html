		<h2>What is WoT - VA? </h2>
		<hr/>
		<p>(W)eb (o)f (T)hings - (V)ertical (Integration)</p>
		<p> In the „Geospatial Web of Things“ study project the idea of the internet of things was applied for mobile water gauges. All together there were three groups working on the project, each with a different approach. Our group, the “Physical Smart Thing”-group (also called the Vertical Integration-Group), had a focus on implementing all smart capabilities on the thing itself.<p/>
		<p>This webside is the result of the combinded effort of all group members. In the hope that this piece of Software will be used one day to prevent surprising floods, we build page with much effort. Even though we did our best to programm without any erros, there might be still some undected ones. If you find any, feel free to fork our code at <a href="https://github.com/mrunde/WoT-Vertical-Approach">https://github.com/mrunde/WoT-Vertical-Approach</a> and enhance it as you like!<p/>
